Let's take a look at the different datasets that we will use during the lessons.

## US American Community Survey (ACS) Census

A simplified version of the [US ACS Census data of 2015](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/table-and-geography-changes/2015/1-year.html)
that contains 3 tables:

| Table Name              |
| ----------------------- |
| states                  |
| congressional_districts |
| places                  |

In the editor below we show by default the `states` table.
Try changing the query to look at the other tables.

export const l0_q1 = `
SELECT *
FROM states
LIMIT 100
`

<SQLSection
    defaultValue={l0_q1}
    autoRun={true}
    classes="editor-wrapper"
></SQLSection>

## Apple Stock

Daily data from the Apple stock from 2017 to 2020. Taken from Yahoo! Finance.

| date         | `datetime` |
| year         | `int`      |
