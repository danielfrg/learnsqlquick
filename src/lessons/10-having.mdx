`HAVING` allows you to filter aggregate columns.

-   It works in the same way as the `WHERE` clause but `WHERE` gets executed **before**
    `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` gets executed **after**.
-   So you can filter both before and after `GROUP BY`
-   It's a good practice to use `WHERE` to only aggregate the data you need for a query

See [order of execution](/lessons/order-execution) for more info.

Let's find out the maximum price of the Apple stock each month and only get the times it was more than $400.

export const l10_q1 = `
SELECT year,
       month,
       MAX(high) AS "high"
FROM apple_stock
GROUP BY year, month
HAVING MAX(high) > 100
ORDER BY year, month`

<SQLSection defaultValue={l10_q1} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>

export const l10_q2 = `
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT year,
        month,
        MAX(high) AS "high"
    FROM apple_stock
    GROUP BY year, month
    ORDER BY year, month
)
WHERE high > 100
`

        <b>Exercise:</b> Find a way to do the same query as above using <code>WHERE</code>. Hint: use a subquery.
