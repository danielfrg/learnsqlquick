`SELECT` is one of the two `SQL` **required** commands (along with `FROM`).

`SELECT` indicates which columns from a table to be returned. `FROM` indicated the target table where the columns live in.

Let's use `SELECT` to get the name, year and population from all the `states`.

export const q1 = "SELECT year, name, total_population\nFROM states"

<SQLSection defaultValue={q1} autoRun={true}></SQLSection>

Use a wild card `*` to get all the columns from a query.

export const q2 = "SELECT *\nFROM states"

<SQLSection defaultValue={q2} autoRun={true}></SQLSection>

## Aliases

Use the `AS` instruction to rename the colummns

export const q3 =
    'SELECT name,\n    total_population as "Population",\n    median_age AS "Median Age"\nFROM states'

<SQLSection defaultValue={q3} autoRun={true}></SQLSection>

## LIMIT

`LIMIT` is a simple command that allow you to specify how many rows
to return from a query.

This is a good practice to avoid returning thousands or millions of rows
from a query.

export const q4 = "SELECT *\nFROM states\nLIMIT 5"

<SQLSection defaultValue={q4} autoRun={true}></SQLSection>

export const q5 = "SELECT name, total_households\nFROM states\nLIMIT 10"

        <b>Exercise: </b> Write a query that selects the first 10 rows the state
        name and the total number households of the state table:
