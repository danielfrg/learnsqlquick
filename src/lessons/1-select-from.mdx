`SELECT` and `FROM` are the two **required** commands, you will always user those.

-   `SELECT` indicates which columns from a table to be returned
-   `FROM` indicated the target table where the columns live in

---

Let's use `SELECT` to get the name, year and population from all the `states`.

export const l1_q1 = "SELECT year, name, total_population\nFROM states"

<SQLSection
    defaultValue={l1_q1}
    autoRun={true}
    classes="editor-wrapper"
></SQLSection>

Use a wild card `*` to get all the columns from a query.

export const l1_q2 = "SELECT *\nFROM states"

<SQLSection
    defaultValue={l1_q2}
    autoRun={true}
    classes="editor-wrapper"
></SQLSection>

## Aliases

Use the `AS` instruction to rename the columns.

export const l1_q3 =
    'SELECT name,\n    total_population as "Population",\n    median_age AS "Median Age"\nFROM states'

<SQLSection
    defaultValue={l1_q3}
    autoRun={true}
    classes="editor-wrapper"
></SQLSection>

## LIMIT

`LIMIT` is a simple command that allow you to specify how many rows
to return from a query.

This is a good practice to avoid returning thousands or millions of rows
from a query.

export const l1_q4 = "SELECT *\nFROM states\nLIMIT 5"

<SQLSection
    defaultValue={l1_q4}
    autoRun={true}
    classes="editor-wrapper"
></SQLSection>

export const l1_q5 = "SELECT name, total_households\nFROM states\nLIMIT 10"

<ExerciseNote>
    <p>
        <b>Exercise: </b> Write a query that selects the first 10 rows the state
        name and the total number households of the state table:
    </p>
    <SQLSection solution={l1_q5}></SQLSection>
</ExerciseNote>

## Create new columns

`SELECT` can also be used to create new columns based on existing ones.
Usually you do this to transform or combine existing columns.

The most common use case is to can use the arithmetic operators (`+-*/`).
For example let's get the percentage of people who are either white or black in each state.

export const l1_q6 =
    'SELECT name,\n    (CAST(white AS float) + black) / total_population AS "percentage"\nFROM states\nLIMIT 10'

<SQLSection defaultValue={l1_q6} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>

<div class="container-text flash flash-warn">
    <p>
        <b>Why do I need</b>
        <code>CAST(white as FLOAT)</code>?
    </p>
    <p>
        Since all columns in the operation are integers the outptut will also be
        an integer. Therefore the output will always be zero. We convert (
        <code>CAST</code>) one column to a <code>FLOAT</code> so that the result
        of the operation is also a <code>FLOAT</code>.
    </p>
</div>
