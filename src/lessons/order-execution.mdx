On important thing to keep in mind is the order how SQL executes the different commands:

| Order | Clause     | Description                             |
| ----- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1     | `FROM`     | Choose and join tables to get base data |
| 2     | `WHERE`    | Filters the base data                   |
| 3     | `GROUP BY` | Aggregates the base data                |
| 4     | `HAVING`   | Filters the aggregated data             |
| 5     | `SELECT`   | Returns the final data                  |
| 6     | `ORDER BY` | Sorts the final data                    |
| 7     | `LIMIT`    | Limits the returned data                |

## Tips

-   This is usually a order to start writing queries, start with `FROM` to get and join tables, filter using `WHERE` and so on.
-   If you are going to use `GROUP BY` be sure to filter anything you can using `WHERE` first
    -   Since `WHERE` is executed before `GROUP BY` you improve performance of an expensive operation such as `GROUP BY`
