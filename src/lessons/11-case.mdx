The `CASE` statement how you handle if/then/else logic in SQL.

The syntax is for `CASE` is:

```sql
CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <return-if-true> ELSE <default-return> END
```

-   The `CASE` statement **always** goes in the SELECT clause
-   You can use any conditionals (like in `WHERE` in the `WHEN` condition
-   You can include multiple `WHEN` statements
-   The `ELSE` statement is optional and its used to with any unaddressed conditions

## Create new columns

You can use `CASE` to create new columns based on a condition.

For example, let's create a new `is_small` state if its population is less than 1000000.

export const l11_q1 = `
SELECT name,
    CASE WHEN total_population < 1000000 THEN true ELSE false END AS "is_small"
FROM states
`

<SQLSection defaultValue={l11_q1} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>

We can ofcourse filter by the new `is_small` column using `WHERE`.

export const l11_q2 = `
SELECT name,
    CASE WHEN total_population < 1000000 THEN true ELSE false END AS "is_small"
FROM states
WHERE is_small = false
`

<SQLSection defaultValue={l11_q2} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>

## Multiple conditions

We can use multiple `WHEN-THEN` pairs to match multiple conditions.

export const l11_q3 = `
SELECT name,
    CASE WHEN total_population BETWEEN 0 AND 1000000 THEN 'small'
         WHEN total_population BETWEEN 1000000 AND 5000000 THEN 'medium'
         ELSE "big"
         END AS "size"
FROM states
`

<SQLSection defaultValue={l11_q3} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>

## Using CASE with aggregate functions

One common use case with `CASE` is to use them with `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions.
In this case we use the created columns to apply aggregated functions.

For example, to count the different groups in the previous example.

export const l11_q4 = `
SELECT CASE WHEN total_population BETWEEN 0 AND 1000000 THEN 'small'
       WHEN total_population BETWEEN 1000000 AND 5000000 THEN 'medium'
       ELSE "big"
       END AS "size",
    COUNT(*)
FROM states
GROUP BY size
`

<SQLSection defaultValue={l11_q4} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>

export const l11_q5 = `
SELECT CASE WHEN name BETWEEN 'A' AND 'M' THEN 'A-M'
            WHEN name BETWEEN 'M' AND 'Z' THEN 'N-Z'
            ELSE NULL END AS group_name,
            COUNT(*) AS "count",
            SUM(total_population) AS "sum"
FROM states
GROUP BY group_name
`

<ExerciseNote>
    <p>
        <b>Exercise:</b> Write a query to count number of states and the total population of two groups:
        1. State name that start from A-M 2. State name starts from N-Z.
    </p>

<SQLSection solution={l11_q5}></SQLSection>
