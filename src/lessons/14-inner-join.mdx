Inner joins eliminate rows from both tables that do not satisfy the condition in the `ON` statement.

-   It's often the case that one or both tables being joined contain rows that don't have matches in the other table.
    For example, not all students in a student table will be in the grades table (if they missed an exam).
    -   The way this is handled depends on the type of `JOIN` you're making.
-   This is the default `JOIN` type but if you want to be explicit you can say `INNER JOIN`.
-   An `INNER JOIN` is the intersection of the two tables
