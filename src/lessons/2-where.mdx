`WHERE` allows you to filter the rows of a table.

Let's get only all the states with more than 10M people living in it.

export const l2_q1 =
    "SELECT name, total_population\nFROM states WHERE total_population >= 10000000"

<SQLSection
    defaultValue={l2_q1}
    autoRun={false}
    classes="editor-wrapper"
></SQLSection>

## Comparison operators

Above we used the greater than operator (`>`).

| Descripton               | SQL operator        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Equal to                 | `=` (single equals) |
| Not equal to             | `<>` or `!=`        |
| Greater than             | `>`                 |
| Less than                | `<`                 |
| Greater than or equal to | `>=`                |
| Less than or equal to    | `<=`                |

export const l2_q2 =
    'SELECT total_population\nFROM states\nWHERE name = "Alabama"'

<ExerciseNote>
    <p>
        <b>Exercise: </b> Does Alabama has more than 4 million people?
    </p>
    <SQLSection solution={l2_q2}></SQLSection>
