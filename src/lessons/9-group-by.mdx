`GROUP BY` allows you to separate data into groups, which can be aggregated independently of one another.

All the aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and `AVG`) can be use with `GROUP BY` to aggregate
data in the different groups instead of aggregating in the whole table.

For example let's calculate the total earnings mean close price for each year of the Apple stock.

export const l8_q1 =
    'SELECT year, AVG(close) AS "mean"\nFROM apple_stock\nGROUP BY year'

<SQLSection defaultValue={l8_q1} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>

<div class="container-text flash flash-warn">
    <p>
        <b>Using the grouped columns in SELECT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that you are able to use the columns in the <code>GROUP BY</code>{" "}
        clause in the <code>SELECT</code> statement.
    </p>
</div>

## Group by multiple columns

You can `GROUP BY` by multiple columns in the same way as `ORDER BY`.

This is used to make more fined grained groups.

-   The order of column names in your `GROUP BY` clause doesn't matter, the results will be the same regardless
-   If you want to control how the aggregations are grouped together use `ORDER BY`

export const l8_q2 =
    'SELECT year, month, AVG(close) AS "mean"\nFROM apple_stock\nGROUP BY year, month\nORDER BY month, year'

<SQLSection defaultValue={l8_q2} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>

## Column numbers

You can substitute the column names for numbers in `GROUP BY`

-   This is mostly useful when you are grouping many columns but remember that explicit is better than implicit
    as changing the `SELECT` statement to reorder the columns might change the actual output.

export const l8_q3 =
    'SELECT year, month, AVG(close) AS "mean"\nFROM apple_stock\nGROUP BY 1, 2\nORDER BY 2, 1'

<SQLSection defaultValue={l8_q3} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>

export const l8_q4 =
    'SELECT year,\n    month,\n    MIN(low) AS "lowest",\n    MAX(high) AS "highest"\nFROM apple_stock\nGROUP BY year, month\nORDER BY year, month'

<ExerciseNote>
    <p>
        <b>Exercise:</b> Write a query that calculates the lowest and highest prices that Apple stock achieved each month.
    </p>

<SQLSection solution={l8_q4}></SQLSection>

</ExerciseNote>
