`GROUP BY` allows you to separate data into groups, which can be aggregated independently of one another.

All aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and `AVG`) can be use with `GROUP BY` to aggregate
data in groups instead of aggregating in the whole table.

Let's calculate number of cities for each state in the dataset.

export const l8_q1 =
    'SELECT state, COUNT(name) AS "number of cities"\nFROM places\nGROUP BY state'

<SQLSection defaultValue={l8_q1} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>

<div class="container-text flash flash-warn">
    <p>
        <b>Using the grouped columns in SELECT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that you are able to use the columns in the <code>GROUP BY</code>{" "}
        clause in the <code>SELECT</code> statement.
    </p>
</div>

## Group by multiple columns

You can `GROUP BY` by multiple columns in the same way as `ORDER BY`.

This is used to make more fined grained groups.

-   The order of column names in your `GROUP BY` clause doesn't matter, the results will be the same regardless
-   If you want to control how the aggregations are grouped together use `ORDER BY`
