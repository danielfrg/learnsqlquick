`JOIN` is the most important clause in SQL as it allows us to go beyond one table
and access and merge data from multiple tables in our queries.

-   `JOIN` always goes after a `FROM` and it's followed by `ON`
-   `JOIN` its followed by a table name, like `FROM`
-   `ON` is a conditional that indicates how the two tables (the one after the FROM and the one after the JOIN) relate to each other
    -   It also indicates how rows will be filtered based on the type of `JOIN` (`INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`)
-   Its a very good practice to use aliases for the tables when doing a `JOIN`
    -   `JOIN` aliases do not require `AS`, just the alias after the table name

Let's take the `places` table that has information about cities in different states.
This table has a `state` column with the ID of the state.

The `states` table also has a column `state` with the state ID.

We can `JOIN` this to tables `ON` the `state`s columns.

export const l13_q1 = `
SELECT P.name, S.name
FROM places P
JOIN states S
    ON P.state = S.state
`

<SQLSection defaultValue={l13_q1} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>
