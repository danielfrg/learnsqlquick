`DISTINCT` allows you to select unique elements in a table.
Yo do with with `SELECT DISTINCT`.

-   `DISTINCT` can be particularly helpful when exploring a new data set,
    looking at the unique values on each column can help you understand the dataset

---

export const l12_q1 = `
SELECT DISTINCT month
FROM apple_stock
`

<SQLSection defaultValue={l12_q1} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>

If you include two (or more) columns in a `SELECT DISTINCT` clause,
your results will contain all of the unique pairs of those columns:

export const l12_q2 = `
SELECT DISTINCT year, month
FROM apple_stock
`

<SQLSection defaultValue={l12_q2} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>

## DISTINCT inside aggregate functions

While you can use `DISTINCT` inside any aggregate function you will use it
almost always with `COUNT`.

-   `MAX` and `MIN` produce the same result with or without `DISTINCT`

export const l12_q3 = `
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT month) AS "unique_months"
FROM apple_stock
`

<SQLSection defaultValue={l12_q3} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>
