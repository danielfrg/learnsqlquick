In addition to the [comparison operators]("/lessons/where) the logical operators
allow you to filter data by more than one condition.

## AND - OR - NOT

These are the 3 most common logical operators:

-   `AND` allows you to select only rows that satisfy two or more conditions
-   `OR` allows you to select rows that satisfy either at least one condition
-   `NOT` allows you to select rows that do not match a condition

For example, lets find out the which states have more than 5 million white people
and where there are more hispanics than black.

export const l3_q1 =
    "SELECT name, white, black, hispanic\nFROM states\nWHERE white > 5000000 AND hispanic > black"

<SQLSection defaultValue={l3_q1} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>

## IS NULL

`IS NULL` compares if the rows of a given column contain no data.

You cannot compare to NULL using the equals operator (`=`) because `NULL`
is a special value in SQL and cannot be used to perform arithmetic operations.

In the `state` table there are some missing values in the `below_poverty_line` columns.

export const l3_q2 =
    "SELECT name, below_poverty_line\nFROM states\nWHERE below_poverty_line IS NULL"

<SQLSection defaultValue={l3_q2} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>

    <ExerciseNote>
        <b>Exercise: </b> What happens if you do{" "}
        <code>WHERE below_poverty_line = NULL</code> instead?
    </ExerciseNote>
</p>

## IN

`IN` compares one value to a list of values.

For example let's say you want to get results for 3 specific states.

export const l3_q3 =
    "SELECT name, total_population\nFROM states\nWHERE name IN ('Texas', 'California', 'New York')"

<SQLSection defaultValue={l3_q3} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>

## BETWEEN

`BETWEEN` compares the value of a column within a certain range. This range can
be hardcoded or another column.

For example, let's find out which states have a number of hispanics between the number of blacks and 100 thousand.

export const l3_q4 =
    "SELECT name, black, hispanic\nFROM states\nWHERE hispanic BETWEEN black AND 100000"

<SQLSection defaultValue={l3_q4} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>

## LIKE and ILIKE.

`LIKE` allows you to match similar values instead of exact values.
`ILIKE` is the same but case-insensitive.

The most common way of using `LIKE` is to compare strings, remember the percent sign (`%`) is used as a wild card.

For example, lets get all the states that start with `T`.

export const l3_q5 = "SELECT name\nFROM states\nWHERE name LIKE 'T%'"

<SQLSection defaultValue={l3_q5} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>

        <b>Strings and single vs double quotes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        In SQL you always use single quotes (<code>'</code>) to create strings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Double quotes (<code>"</code>) are used to refer to column names. For
        example if you had a column named <code>group</code> you would wrap it
        in double quotes so its not confused with the
        <code>GROUP</code> statement.
    </p>
</div>
