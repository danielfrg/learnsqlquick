In addition to the [comparison operators]("/lessons/where) the logical operators
allow you to filter data by more than one condition.

## AND - OR - NOT

These are the 3 most common logical operators:

-   `AND` allows you to select only rows that satisfy two or more conditions
-   `OR` allows you to select rows that satisfy either at least one condition
-   `NOT` allows you to select rows that do not match a condition

For example, lets find out the which states have more than 5 million white people
and where there are more hispanics than black.

export const l3_q1 =
    "SELECT name, white, black, hispanic\nFROM states\nWHERE white > 5000000 AND black > hispanic"

<SQLSection defaultValue={l3_q1}></SQLSection>

## IS NULL

`IS NULL` compares if the selected rows that contain no data in a given column.

You cannot compare to NULL using the equals `=` operator because `NULL`
is a special value in SQL and cannot be used to perform arithmetic operations.

In this particular data set there are some missing values in the `below_poverty_line` columns.

export const l3_q2 =
    "SELECT name, below_poverty_line\nFROM states\nWHERE below_poverty_line IS NULL"

<SQLSection defaultValue={l3_q2}></SQLSection>

        <b>Exercise: </b> What happens if you do{" "}
        <code>WHERE below_poverty_line = NULL</code> instead?
    </ExerciseNote>

## IN and BETWEEN

-   IN compares the value of a column to a list of values
-   BETWEEN compares the value of a column within a certain range

## LIKE

LIKE allows you to match similar values instead of exact values.
