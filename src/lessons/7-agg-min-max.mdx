`MIN` and `MAX` are part of the aggregate functions that are used to perform operations across entire columns (vertically).
This are similar to the arithmetic operations that perform operations in rows (horizontally).

`MIN` and `MAX` return the lowest and highest values in a particular column, respectively.

You can use `MIN` and `MAX` on any column type, numerical, string, dates, and so on.

-   `MIN` will return the lowest number, earliest date, or non-numerical value as close alphabetically to "A"
-   `MAX` will return the highest number, the latest date, or the non-numerical value closest alphabetically to "Z"

Let's find out the state with the lowest population.

export const l7_q1 = "SELECT name, MIN(total_population)\nFROM states"

<SQLSection
    defaultValue={l7_q1}
    autoRun={true}
    classes="editor-wrapper"
></SQLSection>

What if we want to find out the state with the lowest **and** highest population.

export const l7_q2 =
    "SELECT name, MIN(total_population), MAX(total_population)\nFROM states"

<SQLSection
    defaultValue={l7_q2}
    autoRun={true}
    classes="editor-wrapper"
></SQLSection>

You can see that the aggregates values in the `MIN` and `MAX` columns is correct,
meaning its showing Wyoming population as MIN and California as MAX, but the `name`
column only shows the value of the latest aggregate function in the `SELECT` statement.

export const l7_q3 =
    'SELECT name, MIN(total_population) as "population"\nFROM states\nUNION\nSELECT name, MAX(total_population) as "population"\nFROM states'

<ExerciseNote>
    <p>
        <b>Exercise:</b> Rewrite the query above to show two rows, one for the
        MIN population and one for the MAX along side the correct state name.

export const l7_q4 = "SELECT name, MAX(white-black)\nFROM states"

<ExerciseNote>
    <p>
        <b>Exercise:</b> Write a query to find out the state with the biggest
        population difference between white and blacks.
