The `ORDER BY` clause allows you to reorder your results based on the data in one or more columns.

This clause should be placed **after** the `WHERE` clause if there is a filter operation.

export const l4_q1 =
    "SELECT name, total_population\nFROM states\nORDER BY total_population"

<SQLSection
    defaultValue={l4_q1}
    autoRun={true}
    classes="editor-wrapper"
></SQLSection>

Note that by default `ORDER BY` sorts ascending order, starting with smaller number (or value).

To change this behavior use the `DESC` clause after the column name.

export const l4_q2 =
    "SELECT name, total_population\nFROM states\nORDER BY total_population DESC"

<SQLSection
    defaultValue={l4_q2}
    autoRun={true}
    classes="editor-wrapper"
></SQLSection>

    <ExerciseNote>
        <b>Exercise: </b> Try using <code>ORDER BY</code> on a string column
        such as <code>name</code>.
    </ExerciseNote>

## Order data by multiple columns

You can order the table by multiple columns. The second column will be used to order
rows between groups of the first one, acting as a tie breaker.

export const l4_q3 = "SELECT * \nFROM places"
export const l4_q4 =
    "SELECT name, state, hispanic\nFROM places\nORDER BY state DESC, hispanic"

<SQLSection
    defaultValue={l4_q3}
    autoRun={true}
    classes="editor-wrapper"
></SQLSection>

<ExerciseNote>
    <p>
        <b>Exercise: </b> Sort the <code>places</code> table by the state in descending order and
        by the number of hispanics.
    </p>

<SQLSection defaultValue={l4_q3} autoRun={true} solution={l4_q4}></SQLSection>

</ExerciseNote>

## Order of execution with WHERE and LIMIT

Order by is an expensive operation specially as the number of rows increases.
the `WHERE` clause is executed **before** `ORDER BY` so be sure to filter the table
before sorting it.

`LIMIT` on the other hand is executed **after** `ORDER BY` so it will not have any
effect on the performance of that operation.
