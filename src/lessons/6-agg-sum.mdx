`SUM` is part of the aggregate functions that are used to perform operations across entire columns (vertically).
This are similar to the arithmetic operations that perform operations in rows (horizontally).

`COUNT` adds together all the values in a particular column.

You can only use `SUM` on columns containing numerical values.

export const l6_q1 =
    'SELECT SUM(total_population) AS "Total population"\nFROM states'

<SQLSection defaultValue={l6_q1} autoRun={true}></SQLSection>

<div class="container-text flash flash-warn">
    <p>
        <b>NULLs in SUM</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Don't worry (that much) about the presence of NULLs when using SUM as
        they will be automatically treated as 0.
    </p>
    <p>
        But do remember to always think about what a missing value means on the
        context of the data and query.
    </p>
</div>

export const l6_q2 =
    'SELECT SUM(total_population) / COUNT(total_population) AS "AVG Population"\nFROM states'

<ExerciseNote>
    <p>
        <b>Exercise:</b> Write a query that calculates the average number of
        people per state (without using <code>AVG</code>).
    </p>
