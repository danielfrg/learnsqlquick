`COUNT` is part of the aggregate functions that used to perform operations across entire columns.
This are similar to the arithmetic operations that perform operations in rows.

`COUNT` counts how many rows are in a particular column.

You can use `COUNT` on any column type, numerical, string, dates, and so on.

We can count all rows in a table.

export const l5_q1 = "SELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM states"

<SQLSection defaultValue={l5_q1} autoRun={true}></SQLSection>

### Count individual columns

export const l5_q2 =
    "SELECT COUNT(name), COUNT(below_poverty_line)\nFROM states"

<SQLSection defaultValue={l5_q2} autoRun={true}></SQLSection>

<div class="container-text flash flash-warn">
    <p>
        <b>
            <code>COUNT</code> counts all not <code>NULL</code> values
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        As you can see in the example above the <code>COUNT</code> is different
        for two of the columns that is because the{" "}
        <code>below_poverty_line</code> column has one <code>NULL</code> value.
    </p>
</div>

Remember the `AS` clause. This is very commonly used with aggregate functions
to clean up the default names returned by SQL, e.g. `COUNT(name)`, to be more meaningful.

export const l5_q3 = 'SELECT COUNT(name) AS "Number of States"\nFROM states'

<SQLSection defaultValue={l5_q3} autoRun={true}></SQLSection>

<div class="container-text flash flash-warn">
    <p>
        <b>Double quotes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that we use double quotes here because we are taking about a column
        name.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the only case where you use double quotes for everything else
        use single quotes.
    </p>
</div>
