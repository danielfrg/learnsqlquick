You can use `WHERE` to filter tables after they have been joined as you would expect.

But there is the option to add extra conditions to the `ON` statement
that filter one or more of the tables.

-   This filter will be executed **before** the tables are joined
-   This will improve the performance of the query since `JOIN` is an expensive operation

---

Let's do a `JOIN` but add and `AND` statement to the `ON` to filter players by a particular position.

export const l16_q1 = `
SELECT P.name AS "player", P.position, S.name AS "state"
FROM basketball_players P
JOIN basketball_state_detail S
    ON P.state_code = S.id
    AND P.position = 'F'
LIMIT 100
`

<SQLSection defaultValue={l16_q1} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>

Why can do the same using `WHERE`.

export const l16_q2 = `
SELECT P.name AS "player", P.position, S.name AS "state"
FROM basketball_players P
JOIN basketball_state_detail S
    ON P.state_code = S.id
WHERE P.position = 'F'
LIMIT 100
`

<SQLSection defaultValue={l16_q2} classes="editor-wrapper"></SQLSection>

        Note that depending on the type of <code>JOIN</code> and the filter
        condition the result of the queries can be different. Think about the
        result you actually need and the structure of the tables.
    </p>
    <p>You can also do subqueries to filter tables before joining them.</p>
